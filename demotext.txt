Why to use?
1. complex front-end

React is a library

Topics to learn:
1. core of react (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
2. comnponent reusability
3. props
4. hooks to propagate changes - useState,useEffect,....

Additional addon to react:
1. router (React router dom)
2. state management (React don't have state management)
	-> redux, redux toolkit, zustand, context API
3. class based component -> legacy code
4. BAAS - backend as a service eg; appwrite, firebase

After REACT:
1. react has no SEO, brouser render of JS, no routing
2. Framework learn -> NextJS, Gatsby, Remix
